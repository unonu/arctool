Installing the Dependencies
---------------------------

Before you can run the tool, you'll have to install a few dependencies.

Install Python 3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the version of Python 3
appropriate for your platform.

Install Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ARCTool depends on two packages:
	* PyQt5
	* pypandoc

To install these packages, use pip, the Python package manager:
	`pip3 install PyQt5 pypandoc`

Running ARCTool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After installing the dependancies, you can test it out.

In the source directory, run:
	`python3 main.py`

Alternitavely, `main.py` has a shebang at the top, so making it executable and
running it should work too.
